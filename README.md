# Drowsiness Detection System

This project is a real-time drowsiness detection system that uses a combination of **computer vision**, **deep learning (CNN)**, and **MediaPipe facial landmark detection** to monitor a user's eye and mouth states for signs of sleepiness. If signs of drowsiness are detected‚Äîsuch as prolonged eye closure, yawning, or head nodding‚Äîan alarm is triggered to alert the user.

## üîç Features

- Real-time webcam-based detection
- Eye state classification (open/closed)
- Yawn detection using mouth state classification
- Head-nod (tilt) detection
- Alerts using audio alarms (different sounds for eyes and yawns)
- Utilizes:
  - PyTorch-trained CNN models (`eye_cnn_model.pth` and `yawn_cnn_model.pth`)
  - MediaPipe for facial landmark tracking
  - Pygame for sound alerts

## üß† Models Used

- Two custom CNN models (`ProjCNN`) trained separately:
  - One for detecting open/closed eye states
  - One for detecting yawning (mouth states)
- Input to each model is grayscale, normalized, and resized to 86x86 pixels

## üõ† Technologies

- Python
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- PyTorch
- Pygame
- TorchVision

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Make sure you have a webcam connected.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python torch torchvision mediapipe pygame
Place the .pth files and alarm sound files in the same directory as the script.

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python DrowsinessDetection.py
Press q to exit the application.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes
Ensure good lighting for more accurate landmark detection.

Model accuracy may vary depending on training quality and input resolution.

The system is designed for a single face in the camera frame.
